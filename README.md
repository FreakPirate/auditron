## Overview

The AI-Enabled Smart Contract Auditor is a sophisticated tool engineered to fortify the security and reliability of smart contracts within blockchain networks. By seamlessly integrating advanced technologies such as Push protocol, MetaMask, and the Linea AI Engine, this auditor empowers developers and auditors with a comprehensive solution for identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities and security risks in smart contracts.

## Features

- **Push Protocol Integration:** The auditor seamlessly integrates with the Push protocol, providing a real-time communication channel for updates and notifications. This ensures that developers and auditors receive timely alerts regarding any critical security events, allowing for swift responses and mitigation.

- **MetaMask Support:** The user interface is designed for a seamless experience with MetaMask. Users can easily authenticate and process transactions securely through the MetaMask extension, ensuring a user-friendly yet robust interaction with the auditing platform.

- **Linea AI Engine:** At the core of the auditor lies the Linea AI Engine, an advanced artificial intelligence system specifically trained to perform in-depth analysis of smart contracts. Leveraging machine learning techniques, Linea identifies vulnerabilities, code smells, and potential security issues, providing a thorough assessment of the smart contract's security posture.

- **Automated Auditing:** Streamline the auditing process with automated scans powered by Linea. The auditor conducts comprehensive analyses of smart contracts, generating detailed reports that highlight potential security threats and areas for improvement. Automation accelerates the auditing workflow, enabling developers to focus on implementing secure coding practices.

- **Customizable Alerts:** Tailor the notification system according to your preferences. Customize alert thresholds and receive notifications through various channels, ensuring that you stay informed about critical security events as they unfold.

- **Interactive Reports:** The auditor generates interactive and user-friendly reports, allowing developers and auditors to explore identified issues in-depth. Reports include actionable insights and recommendations for addressing security concerns, facilitating an efficient remediation process.
